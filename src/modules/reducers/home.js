/**
 * The reducer is a pure function that takes the previous state and an action, and returns the next state.
 * It's called a reducer because it's the type of function we would pass to
 * Array.prototype.reduce(reducer, ?initialValue).
 * It's very important that the reducer stays pure. Things we should never do inside a reducer:
 * > Mutate its arguments;
 * > Perform side effects like API calls and routing transitions;
 * > Call non-pure functions, e.g. Date.now() or Math.random().
 *
 * To know about avoiding mutation in redux being fundamental and necessary
